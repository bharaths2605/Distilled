# Technical challenge

## Project Overview

The be-tech-challenge project is a 'crud like' api that manages global user preferences across the platform. There are apis that expose read/write operations for a UserPreferences model. This simple model identifies a user by id and keep tracks of a user's profile preferences.
 
SpringBoot 2.x is the stack powering the api. During the challenge, if there are Spring feature(s) that could be leveraged to achieve better code quality, please point them out. Similarly, if there are any other improvements that you think would improve the code please highlight them.
 
## What you are being asked to do?  

We are asking you to complete the open Pull request, by reviewing the code and submitting your comments. 
There are no algorithms or complex logic to worry about, the exercise is purely to review the code and give your view on what could be improved. Note: There is no need to worry about testing at this point. 

Things to keep in mind and watch out for when reviewing the Pull Request: 

* Simple and readable code
* Clean code practices
* Proper use of Java APIs
* Object Oriented Practices
